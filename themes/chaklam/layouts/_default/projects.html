      <h3>Research Topics</h3>

      <ol class="project-list">

  <ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Liveness Detection:</strong> 
    This is the critical gatekeeper for digital identity. Without it, any face-based authentication system is insecure and vulnerable to simple attacks. Key problems include defending against sophisticated fraud (deepfakes, 3D masks, morphing attacks), reducing demographic bias, and making models small and fast for on-device use.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>Facial Recognition:</strong> 
    It's a powerful and widely-used technology for identification and access control, but it carries significant technical and societal risks. Key problems are ensuring fairness and eliminating demographic bias, protecting systems against adversarial attacks, and establishing clear ethical best practices and standards.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>OCR (Optical Character Recognition):</strong> 
    It's the core technology for digitizing the physical world, unlocking vast amounts of information trapped in paper documents, forms, and "in-the-wild" images. Key problems are accurately reading complex layouts (like tables or forms), deciphering handwritten text, and handling low-quality or distorted images.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>Agentic AI:</strong> 
    This research shifts AI from a simple "tool" to an autonomous "assistant" that can understand complex goals, create plans, and execute multi-step tasks. Key problems include developing robust reasoning and planning frameworks, ensuring safety and controllability, and designing effective multi-agent (and human-agent) collaboration.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>Synthetic Personas:</strong> 
    It offers a revolutionary way to gain rapid, scalable, and deep user insights for market research, potentially replacing slow and expensive traditional methods. Key problems are validating that the insights from AI personas accurately reflect real human behavior and avoiding the "echo chamber" of an AI modeling its own biases.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>Medical VQA (Visual Question Answering):</strong> 
    This technology can act as a "co-pilot" for radiologists and doctors, helping them interpret complex medical scans (like X-rays or MRIs) by answering natural language questions. Key problems are the extreme need for accuracy and reliability in a high-stakes medical environment, the lack of large-scale annotated datasets, and building models that can truly "reason" about medical images.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>Human-AI Interaction:</strong> 
    This is the foundational research for ensuring AI makes us *better*, not just replaces us. It focuses on designing collaborative systems that augment human cognition and creativity. Key problems are designing AI that is truly collaborative, understandable, and controllable; measuring its real impact on human learning and creativity; and ensuring it supports human well-being.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>Speech2Text and Voice Cloning:</strong> 
    It breaks down communication barriers, makes content accessible, and creates new possibilities for personalized digital assistants and creative media. Key problems are achieving high accuracy in noisy, real-world environments with diverse accents; creating controllable, high-fidelity voice clones; and addressing the ethical risks of deepfake audio.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>EEG (Brain-Computer Interfaces):</strong> 
    BCI offers a life-changing communication channel for people with severe motor disabilities and represents a future modality for all human-computer interaction. Key problems are improving the low speed and signal-to-noise ratio of non-invasive EEG, reducing user fatigue, and engineering hybrid BCI systems (like SSVEP/P300) that are robust for daily use.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>Raman Spectroscopy:</strong> 
    This research could lead to a new class of non-invasive medical diagnostics, such as a "no-prick" portable glucose monitor, making daily health monitoring painless and accessible. Key problems are extracting a clear, reliable signal (e.g., glucose) from the highly complex and "noisy" spectroscopic data of human tissue, and engineering an accurate, portable, and affordable device.
  </li>
</ul>

            <p>
              We study how AI can be designed to augment rather than replace human abilities. 
              Our focus is on enhancing cognition, creativity, and decision-making while 
              supporting well-being and fairness. We also explore the design of AI-enabled 
              applications such as tutors, interviewers, and mental health companions, with 
              attention to human growth and well-being.

            <strong>Topic 2: Natural Language Processing</strong>
            <p>
              Our NLP research explores how to make language and speech technologies more 
              efficient, accessible, and powerful. We investigate training frameworks for 
              compact small language models that retain much of the capability of large 
              models, while also advancing speech recognition, diarization, and mixed-language 
              processing to perform robustly in real-world environments.   We are also interested to combine 
              computer science techniques like ontology or first-order logic to improve reasoning capabilities of small language models.

            <p>
              Beyond applications, we focus on the foundations of building better models. This includes analyzing neural architectures, adding novel components for improved reasoning, and developing multimodal systems that integrate vision, language, and domain knowledge. We are especially interested in high-impact areas such as medical visual question answering (VQA).
