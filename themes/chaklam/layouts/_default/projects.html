      <h3>Culture & Research Philosophy</h3>
      <p>
        We are an interdisciplinary team working on the fundamental models of
        <strong>Computer Vision</strong>,
        <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong>, and <strong>Multimodal Learning</strong>.
        Our philosophy is simple:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Rigorous & Reproducible</strong>: We don't just chase state-of-the-art numbers. We conduct experiments that explain <em>why</em> models behave the way they do.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Efficient & Scalable</strong>: We focus on algorithms that are computationally efficient, making high-level AI accessible on standard hardware.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Lab Entry</h3>
      <p>
        We welcome students who are curious and ready for hard work. We target top-tier conferences 
        such as <strong>NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR, ACL, and ACM CHI</strong>.
      </p>

            <strong>Robust & Fair Biometrics (Vision):</strong>
            We move beyond standard facial recognition to solve fundamental issues in robustness. 
            Key thesis topics include <em>Adversarial Defense</em> (protecting against physical attacks), 
            <em>Liveness Detection</em>, and <em>Fairness</em> (ensuring models work equally well across all demographics and lighting conditions).
          </li>
          
          <li class="project-item-text">
            <strong>Document Intelligence (Vision + Language):</strong>
            Standard OCR is solved, but understanding complex documents is not. 
            We research <em>Multimodal Layout Understanding</em>—teaching models to read charts, tables, 
            and unstructured layouts by combining visual features with textual semantics.
          </li>
          
          <li class="project-item-text">
            <strong>Efficient Machine Learning (SLMs):</strong>
            While the world focuses on massive models, we focus on efficiency. 
            We research <em>Small Language Models (SLMs)</em>, quantization, and knowledge distillation. 
            The goal is to retain the reasoning capabilities of LLMs while drastically reducing compute costs for edge devices.
          </li>
          
          <li class="project-item-text">
            <strong>Speech Representation Learning (Audio):</strong>
            We aim to improve speech understanding without relying on massive labeled datasets. 
            Research focus includes <em>Self-Supervised Learning</em> to handle diverse accents, 
            code-switching (mixing languages), and noisy environments.
          </li>
          
          <li class="project-item-text">
            <strong>Generative Audio & Safety (Audio):</strong>
            We work on <em>Controllable Synthesis</em>—generating speech with specific emotions and prosody. 
            Parallel to this, we research <em>AI Safety</em>, specifically developing methods to detect deepfakes 
            and synthesized voice attacks.
          </li>
          
          <li class="project-item-text">
            <strong>Multimodal Affective Computing (HCI):</strong>
            We research how to model human internal states by combining voice and text. 
            Instead of simple sentiment analysis, we look at <em>Context-Aware Emotion Recognition</em> 
            to better understand stress, cognitive load, and mental health indicators.
