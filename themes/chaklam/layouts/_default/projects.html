      <h3>Culture & Research Philosophy</h3>
      <p>
        Our interdisciplinary team works at the foundational models of
        <strong>computer vision</strong>,
        <strong>natural language processing</strong>, and <strong>multimodal learning</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Experimental</strong>: Conduct reproducible experiments that
          advance fundamental understanding.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Computational</strong>: Leverage algorithms, models, and
          coding expertise to tackle challenging questions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Lab Entry</h3>
      <p>
        We welcome students from all disciplines with strong curiosity and a
        passion for rigorous, original research. We commonly submit our work to
        conferences including ACL, NIPS, CVPR and ACM CHI.

            <strong>Facial Recognition:</strong>
            Developing accurate and fair facial recognition systems remains a
            significant challenge. Key thesis problems include addressing bias
            in training data, improving recognition accuracy under varying
            lighting and occlusion conditions, and enhancing privacy-preserving
            techniques.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>OCR (Optical Character Recognition):</strong>
            Extracting text from images and documents is essential for
            digitization and information retrieval. Key thesis problems include
            improving accuracy on complex layouts and fonts, handling
            multi-language documents, and developing efficient algorithms for
            real-time applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Small Language Models (SLMs):</strong>
            While large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant
            attention, SLMs are crucial for resource-constrained environments.
            Key thesis problems include optimizing model architectures for
            efficiency, developing effective training techniques with limited
            data, and ensuring robust performance across diverse tasks and
            domains.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Speech2Text:</strong>
            Converting spoken language into text is crucial for accessibility
            and human-computer interaction. Key thesis problems include
            improving accuracy in noisy environments, handling diverse accents
            and dialects, and developing real-time transcription systems. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Text2Speech and Voice Cloning:</strong>
            Generating natural-sounding speech from text has many applications,
            but challenges remain in prosody, emotion, and voice diversity. Key
            thesis problems include improving the naturalness and expressiveness
            of generated speech, developing robust voice cloning techniques,
            and addressing ethical concerns around consent and misuse.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Voice Sentiment:</strong>
            Analyzing sentiment from voice data is important for customer
            service and mental health applications. Key thesis problems include
            improving accuracy across different languages and cultures,
            handling background noise, and developing real-time sentiment
            analysis systems.
